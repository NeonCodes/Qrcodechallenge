## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS stylesheets
- desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned that sometimes the solution is simpler than you may think:
 I spent a significant amount of time wondering:1 how to move the second half of the text to the bottom: I though I had to use some complex CSS code or something. After first googling it, I used a <pre></pre>tag.
2- Later, after looking at the picture of the final result, I realised there was too much space between the two lines in the title. Again, went thinking it was CSS related. I ended googling it again and found the <br> tag--which, for some mysterious reason, I forgot existed--, and that ended up fixing it.
I also googled how to make the image's corners round.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
proud of the styling in this h1
h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 700;
font-size: 40px;
color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%) hsl(216, 15%, 48%) hsl(218, 44%, 22%) ;
}
```

### Continued development
I realised while I got HTML basics mostly covered, I still need to work more on CSS(especially the box model)

### Useful resources

- [Microsoft Edge](the search engine)- This helped me, along with Copilot, to find the solution to that sentence break and round corner shenanigans.
