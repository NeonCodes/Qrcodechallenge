## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS stylesheets and flexbox


### What I learned
Solution 1
I learned that sometimes the solution is simpler than you may think:
 I spent a significant amount of time wondering:1 how to move the second half of the text to the bottom: I though I had to use some complex CSS code or something. After first googling it, I used a <pre></pre>tag.
2- Later, after looking at the picture of the final result, I realised there was too much space between the two lines in the title. Again, went thinking it was CSS related. I ended googling it again and found the <br> tag--which, for some mysterious reason, I forgot existed--, and that ended up fixing it.
I also googled how to make the image's corners round.

Solution 2
1- Receiving feedback and having the right resources can save a huge a amount of time
2- I should have used the complete Figma design file from the start (didn't notice there were multiple pages to it at first)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css

### Continued development
I realised while I got HTML basics mostly covered, I still need to work more on CSS(especially the box model and more flexbox)
